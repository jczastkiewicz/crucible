// the identical "shared, so neither" reason amount.go/defined.go each sit
// apart from their own first callers: checkland-style replacement effects
// (replacement.go's own tapAbilityResolvesTap) and dealDamageEffect
// (dealdamageeffect.go) both gate an ability's own resolution on it, a
// distinct question from CardTraitBase's own meetsCommonRequirements a
// trigger checks before firing at all (triggerCommonRequirementsMet,
// trigger.go) -- the two families share param shapes (isPresentMatches/
// checkSVarMatches, trigger.go, generalized to take either family's own key
// names) but never their own vocabulary: Condition$ itself (Threshold,
// Metalcraft, Delirium, Hellbent, Revolt, Kicked, Surge, Bargain, ...) is
// SpellAbilityCondition's OWN separate switch (setConditions,
// SpellAbilityCondition.java), not built here -- a card naming it skips via
// subAbilityUnresolvedParams below, the identical GO-7 contract.
