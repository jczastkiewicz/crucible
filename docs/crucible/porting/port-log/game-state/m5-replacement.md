# Port Log — Game State: M5 batch C, replacement effects

- **Parent:** [`game-state.md`](../game-state.md) — Java counterpart, model, index, `Not ported yet`
- **Go:** [`internal/engine`](../../../../../crucible/internal/engine) — `replacementchoice.go`, `replacement.go`,
  `control.go`

Siblings: [`replacement.md`](replacement.md) (the first replacement shapes), this file (CR 616 ordering, the next
`Event$` values, `Moved` destinations).

## CR 616: the affected player chooses

Java: `ReplacementHandler.run` (`ReplacementHandler.java:169-290`). Per `ReplacementLayer`: collect the candidates
(`getReplacementList`), let the decider pick one (`chooseSingleReplacementEffect`), mark it `hasRun`, apply it, and on
an `Updated` result run the event again without it; `Replaced` ends the event; `NotReplaced` (declined, nothing to do)
tries the others. The decider is the affected player, or the affected permanent's controller.

`runReplacements` (`replacementchoice.go`) is that loop. A dispatch hands it a `collect` closure that lists the
candidates in play order (players, zones, cards, faces, lines: `eachReplacementRule`) and, per candidate, an `apply`
closure that edits the event the dispatch owns and returns Replaced, Updated or NotReplaced. `collect` runs again after
every applied effect, so a line gated on the amount (`DamageAmount$`) sees the updated one.

| Dispatch                                     | Event$       | Decider                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `drawReplaced`                               | `Draw`       | the drawing player            |
| `gainLifeReplaced`                           | `GainLife`   | the player gaining            |
| `damageReplaced` (`damageReplacement`)       | `DamageDone` | the damaged card's controller |
| `damageReplacedPlayer` (`damageReplacement`) | `DamageDone` | the damaged player            |

`PlayerController.ChooseReplacementEffect(g, decider, options []ReplacementOption) int` is the hook, with its own caller
here and nowhere else. `ScriptedController` answers from `QueueReplacementEffect(i)`; the fixture verb is
`queue replacement <index>`, the index into the candidates in play order. Like Java's human controller it does not ask
for a lone candidate, nor for several that read the same (one permanent, one `Description$`; two copies of a card are
two permanents and are asked). A controller answering out of range records a pending error and gets the first candidate
(GO-7).

Two Furnaces of Rath compound (2, 4, 8). Rhox Faithmender (twice) and Angel of Vitality (plus 1) turn a gain of 6 into
13 or 14 depending on the order.

| Scenario                                           | Proves                                            |

| `replacement-616-gain-life-plus-one-then-doubling` | index 1 applies Angel first: 6 gives 14           |
| `replacement-616-damage-doubling-then-plus-one`    | Furnace then Thor: 2 gives 5                      |
| `replacement-616-damage-plus-one-then-doubling`    | Thor then Furnace: 2 gives 6                      |
| `replacement-616-two-furnaces-quadruple-damage`    | two identical shapes compound, one question asked |

Not ported: Java's `ReplacementLayer` order (CantHappen, Control, Copy, Transform, Other) as one loop per layer. The
Copy layer (`applyCopyReplacements`) and the `Prevent$ True` / `Layer$ CantHappen` shapes run in their own functions
before these four, which is Java's order; a `Draw`/`GainLife`/`DamageDone` line with another `Layer$` is not resolved. A
`ReplaceWith$` the dispatch cannot resolve is a candidate whose `apply` does nothing, so with two or more live
candidates the player can be asked about one that then declines. `Draw`'s `ReplaceWith$ DB$ Draw` draws directly rather
than raising a new `Draw` event, so a second draw replacement does not see the replacement's own cards (Java does, with
the first marked `hasRun`).

## Event$ values past the first shapes

Real R: line counts from the corpus (1,717 lines). Already resolved elsewhere: `AddCounter`, `CreateToken`,
`ProduceMana`, `DeclareBlocker` (`replacement.go`), `GameLoss`/`GameWin` `CantHappen` (`gameloss.go`), `Destroy` with
`Regeneration$` (`regeneration.go`). The unresolved rest, in count order, and what `replacementevents.go` ports:

| Event$        | Lines | Shape ported                                                          | Java                                              |
| ------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `Counter`     | 118   | `Layer$ CantHappen`, `ValidCard$`, `ValidSA$ Spell[.props]` (117)     | `CounterEffect.removeFromStack`, `ReplaceCounter` |
| `BeginPhase`  | 21    | `Skip$ True` with `Phase$`, optional `ValidPlayer$`, `Hellbent$` (20) | `PhaseHandler.advanceToNextPhase`                 |
| `LifeReduced` | 8     | `ReplaceEffect` on `Amount` (limit, double), `CantHappen`, `Result$`  | `Player.loseLife`, `ReplaceLifeReduced`           |
| `LoseMana`    | 5     | `ReplaceMana` `ReplaceType$` converts the pool instead of emptying it | `ManaPool.clearPool`                              |
| `BeginTurn`   | 5     | `Skip$ True` with `ExtraTurn$ True` (4)                               | `PhaseHandler.getNextActivePlayer`                |

Details that are not obvious from the Java:

- **Counter hosts.** A line with no `ActiveZones$` applies from any zone (`TriggerReplacementBase.zonesCheck`), which is
  how a spell's own "can't be countered" works from the stack; `counterCantHappen` always includes the spell itself as a
  host. `ValidSA$ Spell.Creature+YouCtrl` reads its properties off the spell's card (`YouCtrl` is the host's
  controller). `CounterEffect` still refuses a `CantBeCountered` static; Guile's `ReplaceWith$` line (and any
  `ValidCause$`) errors when it is live and no resolvable line stopped the counter.
- **BeginPhase before one-shot skips.** `advanceStep` checks `beginPhaseSkipped` before `consumeSkip`, so a static skip
  leaves a `SkipPhase` effect unspent. Java lets the player choose; a skip is a skip either way. Fasting's `Optional$`
  line records a pending error when it applies.
- **BeginTurn.** Java's `isExtraTurn` is "the extra-turn stack is not empty after the pop"; the bottom entry is the
  normal turn. Time Vault's optional skip is a pending error.
- **LifeReduced** runs from `LoseLife` and from damage to a player (`isDamage`); infect damage is poison, not a loss.
  `Result$ LT1` compares life minus the loss. Worship's `LimitMax.Difference` needed `LimitMax`/`LimitMin` in
  `resolveReplaceCountAmount` and an inline `ReplaceCount$` in `VarValue$` (Bloodletter). The player property
  `lifeGE<n>` (a literal n) joined `matchesPlayerProperty`. `Monarch$ True` in the common requirements is now the host
  controller being the monarch (it rejected every line before), which Archon of Coronation's `CantHappen` needs.
- **LoseMana** runs when `emptyManaPools` finds a non-empty pool: `Pool.convertTo` moves every unit to the named type,
  snow kept as snow.
- `eachReplacementRule` walks `liveTraitFaces`, so a transformed or modal card's other face is not a host.

Not ported: `Destroy` without `Regeneration$` (Harmonious Emergence), `TurnFaceUp` (8), `Transform` (4), `RollDice` (4),
`Attached` (3), `Scry`/`Mill`/`DrawCards` (2 each), the `Optional$` ReplaceWith lines (Fasting, Time Vault), and the
rest at one line each. `LifeReduced` lines whose `ReplaceWith$` is not a `ReplaceEffect` (Enduring Angel's Transform)
record a pending error when they apply.
