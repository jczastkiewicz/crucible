description:
  Port a large batch of M6 ApiType effects (roughly 8 or more) by splitting it across parallel effect-porter /
  effect-porter-hard subagents in their own worktrees, then merging, reconciling counts and docs, gating and cleaning
  up. Use when asked to port "at least N APIs", "the next big pack", or any M6 batch too big for one context.

# Port a batch through parallel porters

For a handful of effects, use `port-effect` inline instead: a worktree porter costs a cold start and a merge. This skill
is the orchestration around it; every porter follows `port-effect` itself.

## 1. Pick

```bash
crucible/scripts/unported-apis.sh 60
```

Drop every API marked `deferred`, unless the batch takes on its blocker. Take the most-used remaining APIs until the
batch reaches the requested size, with about 20% extra. Reason: some APIs turn out unportable once researched, and the
batch still has to reach its size.

## 2. Triage and group

Per API, decide routine or hard (definitions in `port-effect` step 0). Read the Java yourself only when the name does
not settle it; otherwise let the porter decide and report back.

Group APIs into porter batches:

| Rule                                                                                                             | Reason                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| APIs that share an engine piece go to the same porter (all token makers; all Animate kin; all face-down effects) | Two porters building the same helper produce two helpers and a conflict                  |
| Routine porter: 5-8 APIs. Hard porter: 1-3                                                                       | A routine batch finishes in one context; a hard one needs room for design                |
| At most 4 porters at once                                                                                        | Each runs `gates.sh full` per commit; more than 4 saturate the machine's `go test -race` |
| Nothing that changes a documented contract (`port-effect` step 0) goes to a porter                               | Needs an ADR first (ADRP-4), which is the user's call                                    |

## 3. Spawn

Commit or stash first: the worktrees branch from the current `HEAD` (`settings.json` `worktree.baseRef`). Then spawn
every porter in one message, so they run in parallel: `Agent` with `subagent_type: effect-porter` (or
`effect-porter-hard`) and `isolation: worktree`. Each prompt names:

- the APIs, and the batch file slug (`effects-<slug>.md`), distinct per porter;
- the other porters' API lists, marked "not yours: do not touch";
- the report expected back (the agent definitions already specify its shape).

Wait for the completion notifications. Do not read a porter's output file mid-run.

## 4. Merge

On the branch that will carry the batch, with a clean tree:

```bash
crucible/scripts/merge-porters.sh list                   # branch, commits not on HEAD, uncommitted files
crucible/scripts/merge-porters.sh merge <branch>...      # cherry-picks, resolves routine conflicts, fixes counts
```

Merge the branch touching the most shared files first. The script resolves `registry_gen.go` (regenerated), index-row
and defect tables (union of both sides), and the count sentence in `CLAUDE.md` and the plan (rewritten from the
registry). It stops on any other conflict with the cherry-pick in progress. Typical ones are both porters adding
`PlayerController` methods, `Game` fields, or `Clone` lines. Keep both sides, since these are additive. Then
`git cherry-pick --continue` and rerun `merge` with the remaining branches.

A porter that left uncommitted work in its worktree shows `uncommitted>0` in `list`. Read that diff before deciding.
Commit what belongs to the batch in that worktree and merge it. Anything else is either explained or dropped, never
silently lost.

Each porter commits its own `PORTER_PLAN.md` (its working plan, per its own agent definition) as scratch, deleted in
its own final commit once its assignment is done. A porter interrupted mid-task (rate limit, timeout) before that
final commit leaves it behind — drop it when merging that branch (it's not part of the batch's deliverable), the same
way any other porter-only scratch state gets dropped.

## 5. Reconcile, verify, commit

1. `## Not ported yet` in `game-state.md`: the remaining-effects sentence, and the largest-gaps list in `CLAUDE.md`
   (fresh `unported-apis.sh` numbers).
2. `gate-runner` subagent: `gates.sh full`. The merged batch is the first time the porters' changes run together, so a
   green porter branch does not imply a green merge. Coverage is the usual failure; `port-effect` step 4 has the
   per-file check.
3. `rules-reviewer` subagent on `git diff <base>..HEAD` plus the working tree. Fix its findings.
4. Commit the reconciliation. The commit hook runs the gates in this checkout.

## 6. Clean up

```bash
crucible/scripts/merge-porters.sh cleanup <branch>...
crucible/scripts/merge-porters.sh list    # must print nothing
```

`cleanup` refuses a branch with commits `HEAD` lacks or a worktree with uncommitted files. For each refusal, merge the
work or ask the user. Never force it. Reason: an orphaned porter branch or worktree is how ported work went missing
before.

## Report

Per API: ported / partial (rejected params) / deferred (blocker). Then the resolved-API count before and after, porter
findings worth the user's attention (Forge bugs, design calls), gates, commit hashes. Never push.
