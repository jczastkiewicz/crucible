# Effects: RingTemptsYou

The Ring tempts you (CR 701.54): a per-player Command-zone effect card whose abilities grow with each temptation, the
Ring-bearer designation and the `Mode$ RingTemptsYou` trigger. Batch file for one API (DOC-12, `port-effect` step 5).

## RingTemptsYou lands

`RingTemptsYou` (49 corpus lines) resolves: the activator's Ring tempts them. `ringtemptsyoueffect.go`, ported from
`RingTemptsYouEffect.java` and `Player.createTheRing`/`setRingLevel`/`setRingBearer` (`Player.java:3289-3351`,
`:1777-1789`).

| Step            | Port                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| The Ring        | Made on first temptation (`createTheRing`), an `IsEffect` card in the activator's Command zone, kept for the rest of the game                                                                                                                                          |
| Count and level | `Player.ringTempted` +1; the Ring's `Def` becomes `ringDef(n)`, the abilities of levels 1..min(n, 4)                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Ring-bearer     | Candidates: every battlefield creature the activator controls, seat then zone order (`getCreaturesInPlay`). None: no pick, the previous bearer stays (`setRingBearer(null)` returns early). One: taken, no question. More: `ChooseCardsForEffect(lo=1, hi=1)`, checked |
| Trigger         | `Mode$ RingTemptsYou` runs with the activator as `TriggeredPlayer`                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

**The Ring follows the Monarch precedent, not a bare field.** `BecomeMonarch`/`TakeInitiative` build a Go-side
`IsEffect` Command-zone card (`designationDef`, `putDesignationCard`, `effects-monarch-initiative-venture.md`); the Ring
reuses both. Reason: its level abilities are real statics and triggers that the existing `traitHosts` walks (layers,
`cantBlockBy`, attack/block/damage triggers) already read off an effect card in the Command zone -- a status field would
need its own hook in each of those walks.

**One definition per level, rebuilt, not appended.** Java's `setRingLevel(n)` adds only level n's abilities, once per
temptation, so after n temptations the Ring holds levels 1..min(n, 4). `temptWithRing` swaps the card's `Def` for a
fresh `ringDef(n)` holding that same set. Built as trees (PORT-2), no string parsed at runtime. The card is kept, so its
timestamp -- the one the Layer 4 static applies at -- stays the Ring's own. Nothing in the engine keys state on a
`*compile.Ability` pointer, so a new definition resets nothing.

### Shared engine pieces

| Piece                                                 | Where                        | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `IsRingbearer` card property                          | `valid.go`                   | `CardProperty.java:160`. True when some player's `Game.RingBearer` is the card                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `ValidBlockerRelative$` in `cantBlockBy`              | `staticability.go`           | `applyCantBlockBy` ignored it, which would make the Ring-bearer unblockable by everything. Resolved shape: `Creature.powerGTX` with X = `Count$CardPower`, X the attacker's power (`matchesValidParam(..., blocker, attacker)`) -- `skulkBlocks`' comparison          |
| Unresolved `ValidBlockerRelative$`: static skipped    | `staticability.go`           | Space Beleren's `Creature.DifferentSector` (1 line) no longer applies unconditionally; skipped, the `matchesValidDefender` contract. `ValidAttackerRelative$` (Ironclaw Curse) left as it was: out of this port's scope                                               |
| `triggeredObjects.blocker`                            | `ability.go`, `trigger.go`   | `TriggerAttackerBlockedByCreature.setTriggeringObjects`' Blocker, recorded by `checkAttackerBlockedByCreatureTriggers`                                                                                                                                                |
| `Defined$ TriggeredBlocker`/`TriggeredBlockerLKICopy` | `defined.go`                 | Read by the level-3 `RememberObjects$`; an error when the trigger recorded no blocker (GO-7). A `CardID` is stable across zone changes, so the LKI spelling names the same card                                                                                       |
| `Mode$ RingTemptsYou` (9 corpus lines)                | `checkRingTemptsYouTriggers` | `playerActionTriggerMatches` with a gate: `ValidPlayer$` against the tempted player, `ValidCard$` against the bearer just chosen -- none chosen matches nothing (`matchesValid(null)`). All four `phaseTriggerZones`, so Ringwraiths' `TriggerZones$ Graveyard` fires |

### New engine state

| State                | Java                                    | Why                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Player.theRing`     | `Player.theRing`                        | The one Ring card, `monarchEffect`'s pattern                                                                                                |
| `Player.ringTempted` | `Player.numRingTemptedYou`              | The count the level follows; `Game.RingTemptedYou`                                                                                          |
| `Player.ringBearer`  | `Player.ringBearer` + `Card.ringbearer` | One field instead of Java's two copies of one fact. `Game.RingBearer` also answers `NoCard` off the battlefield or under another controller |

All three are values `Game.Clone` copies with the `Player` struct (`TestRingStateSurvivesClone`); no new allocation.

**Losing the Ring-bearer (CR 701.54a).** Java registers a leaves-play and a change-controller `GameCommand` on the
bearer. Here `loseRingBearer` runs from `Move`/`MoveToLibraryTop` leaving the battlefield and from `changeControllerAt`
on a real controller change -- the `controllerChangeZoneCorrection` point, where the port already drops a creature from
combat. Once cleared it stays cleared when control comes back, as in Java. `Game.RingBearer`'s zone/controller check
also covers a Layer 2 static control change, which reaches no `changeControllerAt`.

**No new `PlayerController` method.** Java's `chooseSingleEntityForEffect` over creatures is `ChooseCardsForEffect` with
`lo = hi = 1`, `Play`'s pattern.

**Fixture keys.** `numringtemptedyou=` and `|IsRingBearer` are Java `GameState` keys, now loaded and dumped
(`game-state-fixture.md`). Scenarios: `ring-tempts-you-nazgul-becomes-ring-bearer` (Nazgûl's ETB tempts, the only
creature becomes the bearer, its own `RingTemptsYou` trigger counters each Wraith) and
`ring-bearer-cant-be-blocked-by-greater-power` (level 1 in combat).

| A `Mode$ RingTemptsYou` trigger whose `Execute$` has `Cost$` |     2 | Call of the Ring (`AB$ Draw \| Cost$ PayLife<2>`), Sauron, the Dark Lord (`Cost$ Discard<1/Hand>`). Trigger resolution here neither asks for nor pays a triggered ability's own cost; resolving would give the draw free. Checked before the count moves |

**Found, not fixed here: a triggered `AB$` `Execute$` with `Cost$` resolves without its cost engine-wide.** No trigger
walk or `Registry.Resolve` reads `Cost$` on a trigger's executed ability, so every such line outside `RingTemptsYou`
resolves its effect for free today. Fixing it needs the optional-cost decision ("you may pay ...; if you do") the
trigger pipeline does not have -- a separate piece, not this API's.

**Not ported, not reached by the corpus shape:** Java's set code on the Ring (`createTheRing(setCode)`, image only);
`RestartGame`'s Ring reset (`RestartGameEffect.java:70-72`) -- `RestartGame` is unported.

**No Forge defect found (PORT-8).**
