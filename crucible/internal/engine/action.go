// CheckStateBasedActions applies every state-based action this port checks
// today and reports whether the game has ended as a result.
//
// Ported from forge-game/src/main/java/forge/game/GameAction.java
// (checkGameOverCondition, stateBasedAction704_5q, and the inline checks in
// its own checkStaticAbilities/state-based-action loop) and
// forge/game/player/Player.java (checkLoseCondition). CR numbers below are
// the ones Java's own comments cite, chased down line by line rather than
// assumed from the rulebook: GameAction.java labels the toughness check
// "Rule 704.5f", not 704.5g, and Forge's own comments disagree with each
// other about a couple of the others (noted where that happens) -- citing
// the wrong letter is worse than citing none, since a reader who goes
// looking for the Java source and finds a different rule at that letter
// has no way to tell whether the port or the citation is wrong.
//
// Twelve of Java's checks are here: CR 704.5b (an attempted draw with
// nothing to draw loses), CR 704.5a (a player at zero or less life loses),
// CR 704.5c (ten or more poison counters loses), CR 704.5q (a permanent
// carrying both +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters loses the smaller pile from each,
// in equal number -- `stateBasedAction704_5q`'s own name is the source for
// this letter), a partial CR 704.5f (a creature at zero or less toughness
// -- printed, Layer 7's own SETPT/MODIFYPT effects (applyContinuousPT,
// continuous.go, recomputed fresh right before this loop runs) and +1/+1 or
// -1/-1 counters all folded in, Card.Toughness's own job -- goes to its
// owner's graveyard), CR 704.5g and 704.5h together (a creature dealt
// damage at least equal to its toughness, or dealt any deathtouch damage
// at all, is destroyed -- destroyDamagedCreatures, below), a partial CR
// 704.5v (a Battle at zero or less defense goes to its owner's graveyard --
// destroyZeroDefense, below), CR 704.5w/704.5x (a Battle's protector --
// assignBattleProtector, below, the first state-based action besides the
// legend rule that needs a PlayerController), CR 704.5m (more than one
// permanent with the World supertype on the battlefield destroys every one
// but the newest, by the same Card.Timestamp every zone change already
// stamps for CR 613's own ordering -- resolveWorldRule, below), and three
// rules Java's own comments do not cleanly single-letter: a "cleanup aura"
// rule (Java's own comment for it, GameAction.java:1511 -- an Aura not
// attached to a permanent on the battlefield, or attached to one that no
// longer matches its own `Enchant` restriction, goes to its owner's
// graveyard; an Equipment or Fortification in the same state just becomes
// unattached), a planeswalker at zero loyalty (`handlePlaneswalkerRule`,
// which Java's own comments do not number at all), and the legend rule
// (`handleLegendRule`, same -- resolveLegendRule, below). Every other rule
// in Java's loop -- indestructible aside (destroyDamagedCreatures checks
// it; nothing else here needs to), the rest of 704.5f's own toughness (a
// "*" with no characteristic-defining effect to replace it, or a Count$
// reference on the printed Toughness field itself -- resolveAmount
// (amount.go) is wired into Mode$ Continuous's own PT params, `ptParam`,
// continuous.go, not this text field yet), the rest of 704.5v's
// own exception (a Battle whose own trigger is still on the stack -- always
// false today, destroyZeroDefense's own doc comment), and the legend rule's
// own Corner Case 1, a Corner-Case-2 permanent's own borrowed names colliding
// with some OTHER legendary's own literal printed name (resolveLegendRule's
// doc comment) -- needs a card-name lookup across every creature card this
// game ever printed, which this port's `*Game` holds no reference for. A
// rule this port has not implemented simply never fires, the same as it
// would in a real game with no permanent that rule applies to.
//
// 704.5b is checked first, matching Java's own order -- its comment cites
// Lich's Mirror (CR 704.7), a card not ported, so today's checks would give
// the same result in any order. Kept anyway: it costs nothing, and a future
// port of that card should not have to notice these were ever reordered.
//
// Java's `canRemoveCounters` guard on 704.5q -- some cards grant "counters
// can't be removed from CARDNAME" -- is a static ability, so it is not
// checked either: nothing this port can build yet grants that effect, so its
// absence changes no card's behaviour today.
//
// Java's own checkStateEffects loops up to nine times, because one SBA firing
// can make another one true (destroying a permanent can, in turn, empty an
// Aura's target -- exactly the interaction 704.5f, 704.5g/704.5h, 704.5v, the
// legend rule, the World rule and the attachment cleanup below have, which is
// why destroyLethalToughness, destroyDamagedCreatures, destroyZeroLoyalty,
// destroyZeroDefense, resolveLegendRule and resolveWorldRule all run before
// cleanupDanglingAttachments rather than on a later call). Nothing here
// cascades a second time: destroying a permanent cannot itself change another
// one's printed toughness, deal it damage, or give it the same name, and
// nothing yet grants an effect that could. One pass is complete; the loop
// returns once a rule that can cascade twice lands.
//
// A game that has already ended skips every check below entirely, the same
// as Java: checkStateEffects returns as soon as checkGameOverCondition finds
// the game over, before its creature loop ever runs.
//
// A GameEnded event fires exactly once, on the call that flips g.over --
// never on a later call finding it already true, and not from any other
// path: this is the only place g.over is set.
//
// CR 104.1's own alt-win -- winsGameEffect (winsgameeffect.go) setting
// Player.Won directly rather than through CR 104.2a's own elimination count
// below -- ends the game immediately, checked first for the identical
// reason: an effect that makes a player win does not wait for every
// opponent to also be eliminated first. More than one Player.Won at once

// list before grouping by name (GameAction.java).

// or more legendary permanents that all carry HasNonLegendaryCreatureNames
// (card.go, applyContinuousNames, continuous.go's own Layer 3 -- Spy Kit's
// own real "has all names of nonlegendary creature cards in addition to its

// same-name duplicate is, after the ordinary name-grouping above has already
// removed its own duplicates -- a permanent already sent to its owner's
// graveyard by the name-grouping does not also need asking about here.

// is some creature card's own non-legendary printed name
// (isNonLegendaryCreatureName, a lookup in the game's *carddb.DB: GO-2's
// injected immutable data, never a singleton) also pulls in every
