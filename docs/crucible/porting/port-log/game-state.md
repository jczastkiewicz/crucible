# Port Log — Game State

- **Java counterpart:** `forge-game/src/main/java/forge/game/Game.java`, `card/Card.java` (8,105 LOC),
  `player/Player.java`, `zone/Zone.java`, `zone/ZoneType.java`
- **Go:** [`internal/engine`](../../../crucible/internal/engine)

The arena, and the handles that address it. Everything else in the engine indexes into this.

## What it does

`Game` owns every entity in one game. Cards and players live in slices; a `CardID` is an index. Zones are keyed by
`(type, owner)`, because a dozen callers have that pair and not the player.

## Handles, not pointers

A `Card` holds no `*Game` and no `*Player` — a `PlayerID` for its controller, a `CardID` for what it is attached to.
That is what makes a game copy a slice copy with nothing to remap, and it is why `valid` and `expr` are separate
packages rather than core members (ADR-0003, ADR-0009).

| Rule                                | Reason                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Slot 0 is `NoCard` / `NoPlayer`     | The zero value of a handle field means "none". Without it, an uninitialised field aliases the first entity |
| Handles are never reused            | LKI snapshots, `Remembered` lists and delayed triggers hold handles to objects that are gone               |
| A bad handle panics                 | An out-of-range handle is an invariant breach, not something a card script can cause (GO-7)                |
| Every zone change takes a timestamp | Continuous effects order by it, so a card that leaves and returns is a new object to the layer system      |

`EntityID` is a card or a player in one 4-byte value, tagged by the high bit. It is stored in the thousands — target
lists, remembered lists, LKI — so it is a handle that compares with `==` rather than a struct with a kind field. The
accessors are `AsCard` and `AsPlayer`, not `Card` and `Player`, because a method named `Card` in the leaf file reads as
a reference to the `Card` type and `enginelint` scores it as one.

## Zone order is the contract

A `Zone` is an ordered set, not a set. A library is a stack, a graveyard's order decides `CardsInGraveyard` and
delirium, and the battlefield's order breaks ties between otherwise simultaneous triggers (GO-12).

A card's zone is recorded twice — in the zone's list and as a reverse index on the card — so `Move` is the only thing
allowed to write either. Two representations of one fact is how a card ends up in two zones at once.

## `compile.DB`, not `carddb.DB`

ADR-0009 names the shared database `*carddb.DB`, but it cannot live in `carddb`: `compile` imports `carddb`, so a
`carddb` type holding `*compile.Card` would cycle. It is `compile.DB` — the compiled corpus, built once at startup,
never written again, shared by pointer across every game goroutine (ADR-0005).
