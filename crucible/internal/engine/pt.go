// PT is the continuous power/toughness effects currently affecting one
// card -- CHARACTERISTIC, SETPT and MODIFYPT, Layer 7's own three
// sub-layers (CR 613.4). Counters are not here: CR 613.4 applies them
// after Layer 7, not as a layer of their own, and Card.Counters already
// tracks them -- Card.Power/Toughness reads both.

// PTEffect is one continuous effect's contribution to a card's power
// and/or toughness. Layer decides how it combines with whatever came
// before: LayerCharacteristic and LayerSetPT replace it, LayerModifyPT
// adds to it (CR 613.4) -- Card.Power/Toughness is what applies that rule,
// this only records the effect.
//
// HasPower and HasToughness matter only for LayerCharacteristic/LayerSetPT:
// a real corpus SetPower/SetToughness line sets just one dimension far more
// often than both together (68 SetPower-only, 9 SetToughness-only lines,
// port-log/game-state.md's "Continuous effects" section), and the
// dimension it leaves alone must stay exactly what came before it, not
// reset to zero -- foldPT (card.go) only overwrites a dimension one of
// these two flags is true for. LayerModifyPT needs neither flag: adding
// zero to a dimension an effect does not mention is already a no-op, the
// reason every ModifyPT-only caller (pt_test.go's own) can leave both
// false.
