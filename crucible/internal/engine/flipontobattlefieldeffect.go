// FlipOntoBattlefield: 2 real (AB|DB|SP)$ FlipOntoBattlefield lines --
// chaos_orb.txt and falling_star.txt, the two Un-set "throw the physical

// no param this port does not read; only AllowRandom$ (0 real lines) is
// rejected outright, defensively.
//
// Ported from
// forge-game/src/main/java/forge/game/ability/effects/FlipOntoBattlefieldEffect.java's
// resolve. The controller picks a battlefield permanent as the "landing
// spot" (chooseCardsForEffect, no bounding-box system exists, Java's own
// TODO at :33 says the same); flipNeighbor then finds one neighbor of that
// spot -- an attachment half the time if the spot carries one, else the
// spot's own left neighbor in its controller's battlefield order, matching
// Java's own getNeighboringCard(tgtLoc, -1). getNeighboringCard(tgtLoc, +1)
// (java:39) is not ported: it never draws (the attachment lottery is gated
// on direction<0) and its result is always discarded (getNeighboringCard
// never returns nil, so java:43's own "lhsNeighbor != null" is always true
// and the rhsNeighbor branch at java:45-47 never runs) -- computing it
// would change nothing this port can observe.
//
// The rest is a straight RNG replay, in Java's own draw order, through
// pkg/javarand (ADR-0010): a 15% chance the card never flips at all (no
// remember, no further draws); otherwise one more draw picks a times-flipped
// count this port also drops (nothing downstream reads TimesFlipped --
// neither chaos_orb.txt's nor falling_star.txt's own SubAbility$ chain names
// a Condition*SVar$ on it -- but the draw itself still has to happen, to
// keep the RNG stream in the same place Java's own would be); then a last
// draw decides whether the flip lands on both the spot and its neighbor, on
// one of the two, or on neither. Aggregates.random(List, count)'s own
// reservoir sampling never actually draws for this file's own randChoices,
// which never grows past 2 elements against a count of 1 or 2 -- verified
// by hand from Aggregates.java's own reservoir loop, `i <= count` always
// true across a 2-element list -- so the two-card hit is a plain slice, not
// a sampled one.
//
// Forge bug (PORT-8): FlipOntoBattlefieldEffect.java:109's own
// getNeighboringCard filter, `c.isPlaneswalker() || c.isArtifact() ||
// (c.isEnchantment() && !c.isAura())`, re-tests the landing spot itself
// (`c`) instead of the candidate under test (`card`) on its own third
// clause. Entering the branch at all only requires ONE of the three OR'd
// conditions on `c`; when a planeswalker or artifact spot enters it without
// also being a non-Aura enchantment, `c`'s own enchantment clause evaluates
// false there and the return degenerates to the correct
// `card.isPlaneswalker() || card.isArtifact()` -- no bug in that case. Only
// a non-Aura-enchantment landing spot makes its own third clause true
// unconditionally, and the whole return degenerates to "true": every
// permanent on that spot's controller's battlefield becomes a valid
// neighbor candidate. Not reproduced: this port rejects a non-Aura
// enchantment landing spot with an error instead of silently sweeping the
// entire battlefield for a card that names no such thing. Chaos Orb, a
// plain artifact, is unaffected by the rejection and resolves normally when
// chosen as the landing spot.
