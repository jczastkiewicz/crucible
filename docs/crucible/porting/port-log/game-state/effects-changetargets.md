# Port Log — Game State: M6 Effects: ChangeTargets

- **Parent:** [`game-state.md`](../game-state.md) — Java counterpart, model, index, `Not ported yet`
- **Go:** [`internal/engine`](../../../../../crucible/internal/engine) — `changetargetseffect.go`, `targeting.go`
- **Builds on:** [ADR-0018](../../../adr/0018-instant-sorcery-spell-object.md) stack-item identity (`Ability.ID`,
  `stackItem`, `spellItemOf`) and [`effects-play-copyspellability-v3.md`](effects-play-copyspellability-v3.md)'s
  `targetChoiceFor`

## ChangeTargets lands

`changetargetseffect.go` ports `ChangeTargetsEffect.java:48-210` (CR 115.7). Corpus: 44 lines. Targeted
Instants/Sorceries reach the stack through `castInstantOrSorcery`, `Play` and `copySpell`, each an `Ability` whose
`Targets` (and each Charm mode's `Targets`) this effect rewrites in place. Registered count 165.

Two halves, split by who reads `TargetType$`:

| Half                        | Who                                   | What it needs                                                                                                   |

| Choosing the spell (push)   | ChangeTargets ability's own targeting | `TargetType$` as `SpellAbility.isValid` over stack items: 31 of 44 lines name it, 23 past the literal `Spell`   |
| Rewriting its targets (res) | the effect                            | the chosen spell's targeting parts, their legal candidates now (`targetChoiceFor`), and the chooser's new picks |

### Engine pieces

Each extends an existing piece. No new `PlayerController` method, no new `EntityID` kind.

Java only collects them in the loop (`runTrigger`), so order is unchanged                                                                                          | `ChangeTargetsEffect.java:178-208`                                                     |

**Why no stack-item `EntityID`.** `id.go` defines `EntityID` as a card or a player (ADR-0009's 4-byte handle); a third
kind changes that contract (needs an ADR first, ADRP-4), every `AsCard` caller would need auditing, and neither
`ScriptedController` answers nor the fixture `targets` verb can name one. So an activated or triggered ability on the
stack that would be a legal target is an `error`, not a candidate left out: offering spells alone is a narrower question
than Java asks. `Ability` carries no activated/triggered kind, so `Activated` and `Triggered` each admit every non-spell
item; that only changes which items raise the error.

### `TargetType$` over a stack item

| Kind / property                   | Reads                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Spell`                           | `Ability.spell`                                                           |
| `SpellAbility`                    | anything                                                                  |
| `Ability`/`Activated`/`Triggered` | not a spell (then the no-`EntityID` error)                                |
| `Instant`, `Sorcery`              | host card's type                                                          |
| `singleTarget`                    | exactly one target across all parts, the same object twice counting twice |
| `numTargets <op><n>`              | distinct targets, literal `n`, `compareOp`                                |
| `IsTargeting Self`/`You`          | the ChangeTargets host card / its controller among the targets            |
| `YouCtrl`, `OppCtrl`              | stack item's controller vs the ChangeTargets controller                   |

Then `ValidTgts$` against the item's host card (`Card,Emblem` matches every card; `Spell` never does, `baseMatches`).

### Resolution

| Targeting parts                            | the spell if it names `ValidTgts$` (Earthbend built in), then each Charm mode that does                                                                                                                                                                                                  | sub-instance chain                |

Inherited, not changed: `isSpellSource` false as `castInstantOrSorcery` passes it for the same spell's cast-time
targets, so a `ValidSource$ Spell` watcher misses both (`becomesTargetSourceMatches`, `trigger.go`; recorded in
`effects-play-copyspellability-v3.md`). `BecomesTargetOnce` has no trigger mode in this port, at cast time or here.

`UnlessCost$` (Divert) fails in `resolveUnlessCost`: no `UnlessPayer$`, whose Java default `TargetedController` is not
resolved there.

### Reachability

End to end today: a `Mode$ SpellCast` trigger whose `Execute$` is ChangeTargets, fired by `CastSpell`
(`TestChangeTargetsRetargetsASpellWithASingleTarget`, `retargeting_test.go`). No real card reaches it yet: `CastSpell`
and `ActivateAbility` require an empty stack (no priority window), Speedball's trigger needs `TargetsValid$`, Perplexing
Chimera's and Commandeer's chains need `ControlSpell`, Wyll's Reversal's parent `Pump` names a `TargetType$` its own
targeting does not read, Captured by the Consulate is broken upstream (below). No effect-driven cast route is known
either: a `Play`/`Discover` cast during a resolution finds nothing left under it to retarget. So no scenario fixture:
nothing a `setup.state`/`actions.log` can drive reaches the effect.

Registered anyway, unlike `Planeswalk` (`effects-batch-a.md`), whose every line resolves to Java's own no-op outside a
Planechase game: ChangeTargets does real, tested work on real stack items, and goes live as soon as a priority window
(or one of the trigger/parent gaps above) lands, with no change here.

### Charm modes that target the stack

`modeHasLegalTargets` (`charmeffect.go`, `makePossibleOptions`' CR 603.3c filter) judges a mode naming `TargetType$`, or
a `CopySpellAbility` mode, by `targetChoiceFor`'s stack scan instead of the battlefield scan. Reason: over an empty
stack the battlefield scan offered Insidious Will's/Untimely Malfunction's ChangeTargets mode (and Return the Favor's
two), mode indices then disagreed with Java's option list, and picking it made the whole Charm silently not cast
(`resolveTargets` false). A `targetChoice.err` keeps the mode, so its error surfaces when it resolves. Regression:
`TestCharmOffersAStackTargetingModeOnlyWithACandidate`.

**Forge defect found.** `captured_by_the_consulate.txt:8`: `Defined$ TriggeredSourceSA` under a `Mode$ SpellCast`
trigger, which never records `SourceSA` (`TriggerSpellAbilityCastOrCopy.setTriggeringObjects`,
`TriggerSpellAbilityCastOrCopy.java:232-251`; `MagicStack.java:377-394` passes only `Activator`, `SpellAbility`,
`CurrentStormCount`, `CurrentCastSpells`). The retarget never happens. Logged in
[`card-script-defects.md`](../../card-script-defects.md); rejected by name meanwhile.
