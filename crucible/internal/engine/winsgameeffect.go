// own elimination count, ending the game immediately the way CR 104.1 says
// an effect-driven win does rather than waiting for every opponent to also
// be eliminated (action.go's own doc comment on CheckStateBasedActions has
// the full reasoning, including CR 104.4a's own simultaneous-win draw).
