// Foretell (CR 702.143): a special action that exiles a card from your hand
// for {2} on your turn, and the later cast of it from exile for its foretell
// cost. Ported from the Foretell branch of CardFactoryUtil.java:2961 (the
// action, an AbilityStatic costing {2} with Hand as its zone) and
// GameActionUtil.java:205-220 (the cast: only from Exile, only the owner, only
// once the card has been there since an earlier turn, for the K:Foretell:<cost>
// cost). The card is not turned face down: the engine is omniscient, and
// nothing reads the face-down state of a foretold card.
