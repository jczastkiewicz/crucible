## Targeted Pump, GainLife's default player, Megrim's discarded card

Three shapes the turn driver's scenarios (ADR-0026) hit first. Each blocked a common card, not an edge case.

| Shape                                                            | Corpus                                                                    | Go                                                               | Java                                                        |

**Pump.** Targets come from `Ability.Targets`, already chosen at cast/activation (ADR-0018). A target that phased out
(CR 702.26e) or left `PumpZone$` (Battlefield by default) since it was chosen is skipped, the same two checks Java's own
loop runs. Java's `tgtPlayers` loop grants a player keywords only; this port has no player keyword record, so a `KW$`
line with a player target fails loudly (GO-7). A P/T-only line ignores player targets, as `applyPump(player)` does.

**GainLife.** `getTargetPlayersWithDuplicates(true, "Defined", sa)`: `Defined$` first, else the chosen player targets,
else `getParamOrDefault("Defined", "You")` (`SpellAbilityEffect.java:339`) — the activator. A player no longer in the
game gains nothing (`!p.isInGame()`). The shared `definedPlayers("")` stays an error: other effects call it too, and
defaulting there would change them without reading their Java.

**Discarded.** Both halves of `checkDiscardedTriggers` — the discarded card's own trigger and every watcher's — record
the discarded card as `AbilityKey.Card`, Java's only triggering object for the mode. `TriggeredCardController` then
reads that card's controller.

Fixtures: `priority-giant-growth-response-saves-creature-from-bolt`, `gainlife-without-defined-goes-to-the-caster`,
`megrim-damages-the-player-who-discarded`; `TestStepRepeatsCleanupWhenItGrantsPriority` uses Megrim's own trigger line.
