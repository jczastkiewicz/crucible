// cantBlockByKeywords is every keyword CardFactoryUtil.java turns into a
// Mode$ CantBlockBy static ability at CardState-build time
// (CardFactoryUtil.java:3906-3935), not a combat-code keyword check --
// Flying's own block restriction is this static ability, generated once for
// every card that carries the keyword, the same way Fear's and
// Horsemanship's are (block.go's own doc comment already established this
// for Flying specifically). ValidAttacker is always "Creature.Self" for a
// keyword-synthesized one, since Java attaches the synthesized
// StaticAbility to the very card carrying the keyword.
//
// Landwalk is not in this table: its own CantBlockBy carries no ValidBlocker
// at all, only ValidDefender$ Player.controls<Type>, and <Type> is the
// keyword's OWN argument (K:Landwalk:Island's own "Island") -- a different
// value per card, not a name shared by every card carrying the keyword the
// way Fear's/Flying's/Horsemanship's/Intimidate's fixed ValidBlocker strings
// are. landwalkType (below) reads it directly off the keyword line instead
// (enchantSpec's own precedent, action.go).
//
// Protection is not here either, for the same per-card reason Landwalk
// is not: its own ValidBlocker is built from the keyword's own argument
// (Protection.getProtectionValid), a different value per card, not a fixed
// string every carrier shares. protectionEach (below) reads it directly.
//
// Skulk is not here either, but for a third reason: its own
// ValidBlocker$ Creature.powerGTX names a Compare property whose operand
// (X) is not a fixed string OR a per-card script value -- CardFactoryUtil's
// own Skulk branch hardcodes `st.setSVar("X", "Count$CardPower")` on the
// synthesized StaticAbility itself, always measuring the ability's own
// host (the attacker, since ValidAttacker$ is always Creature.Self). A
// non-numeric Compare operand is otherwise unresolvable (compareMatches'
// own doc comment, valid.go), but X here is not a compareMatches question
// at all once that hardcoding is known: skulkBlocks (below) is a direct
// power comparison, cantBlockBy's own call site (below) checked against
// h.ID == attacker directly rather than through this table's fixed-string
// shape.
//
// Menace is not here either, but for a different reason: Forge itself does
// not run Menace through the static-ability engine at all --
// StaticAbilityCantAttackBlock.getMinMaxBlocker hardcodes
// `attacker.hasKeyword(Keyword.MENACE)` directly, a minimum-blocker-COUNT
// rule CantBlockBy's per-blocker-identity check cannot express. It is
// checked on the whole declaration instead, with Mode$ MinMaxBlocker's
// counts, by validateBlocks' per-attacker blocker count (minMaxBlockers,
