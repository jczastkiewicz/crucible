# Port: Keywords

- **Java source:** `forge-game/src/main/java/forge/game/keyword/Keyword.java` (354, its enum and `getKeywordDetails`),
  the 27 `KeywordInstance` subclasses beside it
- **Go target:** `crucible/internal/keyword`
- **Status:** Parsing and the definition table done — M3 slice F. Expansion into triggers, statics and abilities is
  `keyword.Expand` (ADR-0038), below. `engine.Card.HasKeyword` (M5) is the first engine consumer, and only ever asks "is
  the bare word present" — it does not expand a keyword into what it grants

## What it does

Reads a `K:` line into a head, its details, and the enum entry that says how the details are shaped. `Flying` carries
nothing, `Ward:2` an amount, `Dash:4 R W` a cost, `Awaken:3:4 U` both.

18,248 `K:` lines in the corpus.

`compile.Face.Keywords` carries the raw lines through from `carddb.Face.Keywords` unchanged (`game-state.md`'s "Lethal
and deathtouch damage" section), the same "carry the printed text, interpret it downstream" split
`Type`/`Power`/`Toughness`/`Loyalty` already use. `engine.Card.HasKeyword(name)` is the interpreter: it calls `Parse` on
each line and compares `.Name`, so a keyword written with arguments (`"Ward:2"`) is still found by its bare head
(`"Ward"`).

## The head is not "everything before the first colon"

`Keyword.getKeywordDetails` has three cases, and the middle one is the reason:

| Line                      | Case                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ward:2`                  | A `:` splits head from details at the first colon  |
| `First strike`            | No colon, so the **whole line** is tried as a name |
| `Bands with other Dragon` | The whole line fails, so the first word is tried   |
| `Flying`                  | No colon, no space: the line is the name           |

Cutting at the first colon gets the first and last right and the middle two wrong. `smartValueOf` is an exact
case-insensitive match on the display name, so the space case is not a prefix rule.

A `:Flavor` suffix, with the space that follows it, is cut from the details before they are read. It is display text,
and leaving it in would make `Ward:2:Flavor Protective Ward` an amount keyword whose amount is not a number.

## What the corpus actually writes

| What                                     | Distinct |   Uses |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------: | -----: |
| Keywords the enum defines                |      199 | 18,062 |
| Pseudo-keywords the card factory handles |       11 |  1,297 |
| Rules text on a `K:` line                |       36 |    144 |

The enum has 203 constants, so four are defined and unused.

The eleven pseudo-keywords are `etbCounter` (475), `ETBReplacement` (405), `Chapter` (236), `Class` (76),
`AlternateAdditionalCost` (42), `MayEffectFromOpeningHand` (30), `Visit` (21), `DeckLimit` (5),
`MayEffectFromOpeningDeck` (4), `MustBeBlockedByAll` (2) and `Prize` (1). They are the vocabulary a compiler owes on top
of the enum, and they are in the golden by name.

The rules-text lines are counted, not listed. `CARDNAME must be blocked if able.` is a keyword only in the sense that
Forge stores it on a `K:` line; it is card text, it would move the golden every time a card is added, and Java resolves
it to `UNDEFINED` and falls back to a simple keyword holding the original string. **An unresolved head is not an error**
— this is the one place in the script language where that is by design.

## The argument shape is the class

The enum names a `KeywordInstance` subclass per keyword, and that class is the contract: `Ward:2` and `Hexproof:White`
are written identically and mean different things. The table records it.

| Shape           | Keywords | Example                        |
| --------------- | -------: | ------------------------------ |
| `Simple`        |       88 | `Flying`                       |
| `Cost`          |       54 | `Dash:4 R W`                   |
| `Amount`        |       27 | `Absorb:1`                     |
| `Special`       |       23 | `Ward`, `Protection`, `Kicker` |
| `Type`          |        5 | `Champion:Elf`                 |
| `CostAndAmount` |        3 | `Awaken:3:4 U`                 |
| `CostAndType`   |        2 |                                |

`Special` is the seventeen classes with a parser of their own plus the six that share one; their details stay text until
the keyword is expanded.

## Deviations from Java

| Java                                                          | Go                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getInstance` reflects a class per keyword and parses eagerly | A table row with a `Kind`. No reflection in the engine (GO-4), and the shape is data    |
| An unresolved head silently becomes a `SimpleKeyword`         | `Entry` is nil and `Kind()` is `Unknown`, so a caller can tell text from vocabulary     |
| `KeywordWithAmount.parse` throws on a non-numeric amount      | The corpus test checks it instead: every `Amount` keyword's argument is a number or `X` |

## Not ported yet

| Java                                                              | When                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `CardFactoryUtil.setupKeywordedAbilities` — expansion into traits | M3, after the effect registry exists |
| The 23 bespoke `KeywordInstance` parsers                          | M5, with the keywords they implement |
| Reminder text formatting                                          | Never. Display only (PORT-6)         |

## Expansion (ADR-0038)

`keyword.Expand(Keyword) (Expansion, bool)` (`expand.go`) ports the `CardFactoryUtil` branches that build a trait from
script text. It returns the `A:`/`T:`/`S:`/`R:` lines and the SVars they name, minus the display params (`PrecostDesc$`,
`CostDesc$`, `SpellDescription$`, `TriggerDescription$`). `compileFace` calls it for each printed `K:` line after the
card's own lines (`CardFactory.getCard` runs `setupKeywordedAbilities` after the face's abilities), stores the SVars per
keyword line (`KWProwess<n>`, so two keywords never collide) and tags each synthesized `compile.Ability` with `Keyword`,
the line it came from. `ok == false` leaves the keyword inert: no template, or details this port does not translate
(GO-7).

| Keyword          | Lines (corpus) | Expands to                                                                                                                                 |

| Equip            |            650 | `AB$ Attach \| Cost$ <cost> \| ValidTgts$ Creature.YouCtrl \| SorcerySpeed$ True`                                                          |
| Cycling          |            306 | `AB$ Draw \| Cost$ <cost> Discard<1/CARDNAME> \| ActivationZone$ Hand`                                                                     |
| TypeCycling      |            106 | `AB$ ChangeZone \| Cost$ <cost> Discard<1/CARDNAME> \| ActivationZone$ Hand \| Origin$ Library \| Destination$ Hand \| ChangeType$ <type>` |
| Crew             |            192 | `AB$ Animate \| Cost$ tapXType<Any/Creature.Other+withTotalPowerGEN> \| Defined$ Self \| Types$ Artifact,Creature`                         |
| Prowess          |            104 | `T:Mode$ SpellCast` (noncreature, yours) running `DB$ Pump +1/+1` on Self                                                                  |
| Exalted          |             35 | `T:Mode$ Attacks` (alone, a creature you control) pumping `TriggeredAttackerLKICopy` +1/+1                                                 |

| Bushido          |             37 | `T:Mode$ Blocks` and `T:Mode$ AttackerBlocked`, both pumping Self +N/+N                                                                    |
| Afterlife        |             11 | `T:Mode$ ChangesZone` (dies) making N `wb_1_1_spirit_flying` tokens                                                                        |
| Persist, Undying |         24, 22 | `T:Mode$ ChangesZone` (dies with no -1/-1 resp. +1/+1 counter) returning `TriggeredNewCardLKICopy` with one                                |

Equip's `ReduceCost$` and `AlternateCost$` extras are not read by any ability this port resolves, so those Equip lines
(about 25) stay inert; an `ActivationLimit$` extra is carried as written. The engine side: `attachEffect` resolves an
activated `AB$ Attach` (`attachActivated`, `castspell.go`) by attaching the source to its first creature target unless
protection refuses; `Draw` defaults `Defined$` to You as `getTargetPlayers` does; Layer 7 reads
`AffectedDefined$ Equipped/Enchanted` (`layers.md`). Granted keywords (`AddKeyword$ Prowess`) do not expand yet: they
need ADR-0023's trait overlay. Persist and Undying needed `ChangeZone`'s `WithCountersType$`/`WithCountersAmount$` (the
permanent enters with the counters before its enter replacements, `moveByEffect`'s `enterCounters`) and
`Defined$ TriggeredNewCard[LKICopy]` (the card a dies or enters trigger recorded); Annihilator needed
`Defined$ TriggeredDefendingPlayer`. Tests: `keywordexpansion_test.go`, scenario
`equip-bonesplitter-attaches-to-a-creature-at-sorcery-speed`. Golden: `TestCorpusAST` changed for the 1,055 cards
carrying these keywords.

### Flashback is casting infrastructure, not an expansion

Java's `Flashback` keyword builds only the exile replacement (`Event$ Moved | Origin$ Stack`); the alternative cost
lives in `GameActionUtil`. ADR-0038 puts it with the casting infrastructure, so it is native: `castFromHand`
(`castspell.go`) offers a graveyard card its owner could cast for the keyword's cost when that cost is a plain mana cost
(`flashbackCost`; a Sac, PayLife or other non-mana flashback cost is not offered), `castOpts.altCost` replaces the
printed cost in `payCastCost`, and `Card.flashbackCast` makes `Game.Move` exile the spell wherever it would leave the
stack (CR 702.34a: a resolved or countered spell, and a permanent entering the battlefield). Timing is the card's own
(an instant at instant speed). A granted flashback (Snapcaster Mage, `MayPlay` grants) is not offered. Test:
`TestFlashbackCastsFromTheGraveyardAndExiles`.

Crew needed the cost shape `tapXType<Any/Type+withTotalPowerGEN>` (`cost.ActivationShape.TapTypeTotalPower`): the
controller picks any number of the untapped candidates through `ChooseCardsForEffect`, and the activation is refused,
before anything is paid, unless their total power reaches N (`ActivateAbility`, `taptype.go`'s `totalPower`).
