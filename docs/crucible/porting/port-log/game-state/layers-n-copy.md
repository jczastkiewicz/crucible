## The Copy layer runs before the move

`ReplacementLayer` order is `CantHappen, Control, Copy, Transform, Other` (`ReplacementLayer.java:9-13`).
`entryReplaced` now runs Control, then `applyCopyReplacements`, then Other, all before `Game.Move`. The old post-move
call is gone from `enterBattlefieldReplacements`.

| Consequence                                                                             | Why                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A Clone under Containment Priest copies first; the Priest reads the copy                | Other layer sees the copied `Def`; a noncreature copy enters           |
| An entry the Other layer replaces away drops the copy effect and any pending counters   | CR 400.7; `entryReplaced` clears both when the card did not land       |
| A card entering from a graveyard is still in it while `Choices$` runs                   | Java's last graveyard state; the "moved out already" divergence closed |
| A copied planeswalker or battle gets its printed loyalty or defense in `Move`           | `Move` reads `BaseLoyalty` from the copied `Def`                       |
| `cloneEffect` accepts a target outside the battlefield only if it is `a.replacedCard()` | The entering card is still in hand, on the stack or in a graveyard     |
| `Choices$` no longer needs the by-hand "not the entering card" filter                   | Nothing on the battlefield is the entrant yet                          |

`AdditionalAbility` children (`resolveAdditional`, `FlipCoin` branches) now carry `replacing`; Molten Sentry's Clone
read an unset `replacedCard()` before, which only worked because its target was the host on the battlefield.

## CR 616.1: several copy replacements

`applyCopyReplacements` keeps its own loop (`gen` identity, `ConfirmEffect` for `Optional$`) and asks
`chooseReplacement` when more than one candidate applies: the player the card enters under is the decider,
`PlayerController.ChooseReplacementEffect` the hook, candidates own face first, then watchers in player order.

Scenarios `copy-order-metamorph-beside-essence-of-the-wild-own-copy-first` / `-essence-first`: the copied Ichor
Wellspring's draw trigger fires only when Metamorph's own replacement went first. Module test
`TestEntersAsCopyAmongSeveralCopyReplacementsTheEnteringPlayerChooses` checks the resulting definitions.

## ETB$ counters in an entry chain

`PutCounter` with `ETB$` while `a.replacedCard() != NoCard` is `putEnterCounters`: the amount is read now (The
Mimeoplasm's `Remembered$CardPower` before `DBCleanup`) and the counters wait in `Card.pendingEnter`.
`applyEnterCounters` merges them into its per-kind piles after the move, so one `AddCounter` replacement (Hardened
Scales) sees the whole pile once. `Defined$` is `Self`, `ReplacedCard` or `ReplacedNewCard`, optionally with a
`.<valid>` suffix (`AbilityUtils.getDefinedCards`' `incR`). `CounterType$ EachFromSource` with `EachFromSource$` puts
one pile per kind the named cards hold (Dominion Saboteur), `CounterNum$` overriding the count. Outside an entry `ETB$`
is still refused.

| Card                 | Shape                                                  | Scenario                                                                                                                                            |

| The Mimeoplasm       | `ChooseCard`, `ChangeZoneAll`, `PutCounter`, `Clone`   | `the-mimeoplasm-enters-as-a-copy-with-counters-equal-to-the-other-power`                                                                            |

`actions.log` gains `queue cardorder <id>[,...]` (`QueueCardOrder`): the two exiled cards of The Mimeoplasm are ordered
by `orderCardsByTheirOwners`.

## Effect-hosted replacements

The `Effect` refusals in `copyReplacementResolvable` are gone. Spark Double and Moritte of the Frost create an effect
card whose `Moved` replacement (Other layer) carries a chain `PutCounter, PutCounter, ChangeZone Self Command to Exile`.
`applyEnterCounters` runs a counter replacement whose chain goes past the first `PutCounter` through the Registry
(`runEnterChain`) after its walk of the replacements, so exiling the effect card never edits what is being iterated.
Scenarios `spark-double-enters-as-a-copy-with-an-additional-counter`,
`moritte-of-the-frost-enters-as-a-legendary-copy-with-two-counters`.

Mystic Reflection's effect card hosts a Copy-layer replacement; `Pump` gains `ImprintCards$`/`ForgetImprinted$`
(`PumpEffect.java:431-437`). The effect ends on its own `Mode$ ChangesZoneAll` trigger, which fires once for a batch:
two cards entering through one `ChangeZoneAll` both copy and the effect ends after the batch
(`TestEffectHostedCopyReplacementCopiesTheWholeBatchOnce`). A lone entry is a batch of one, so `permanentEffect`,
`attachEffect` and `PlayLand` now call `checkChangesZoneAllTriggers` after the ETB check; `moveByEffect` callers and
`Play` already fire their own. Scenario `mystic-reflection-next-creature-enters-as-a-copy-of-the-chosen`.

## Clone's rejected params

Corpus lines naming each (real `(AB|SP|DB)$ Clone` lines, same-line):

| Param                                                                                                     | Lines | Cards                                           | Outcome                                                                                                                 |

| `PumpKeywords$`/`PumpDuration$`                                                                           |     2 | Loose in the Park, The Fourteenth Doctor        | kept rejected: both lines also need a blocked `Defined$ ExiledWith` / `ThisTurnEnteredFrom_Library`                     |
| `Embalm$`/`RemoveCost$`                                                                                   |     1 | Vizier of Many Faces                            | kept rejected: embalmed state and mana-cost rewriting                                                                   |
| `SetManaCost$`, `SetColorByManaCost$`, `SetCreatureTypes$`, `RemoveKeywords$`, `SetLoyalty$`, `GainText*` |     0 | —                                               | kept rejected, no corpus line                                                                                           |

`RemoveCardTypes$` clears the core types and keeps supertypes; `RemoveSubTypes$`, read only under it, then drops every
subtype, since no core type is left to allow one.

## Condition$ EnduringStory

`Player.EnduringStory` is set by `assignEnduringStories` (state-based actions, like `assignBlessings`): a `Storied`
permanent on the battlefield whose controller has three or more `Permanent.YouCtrl+Historic` gives them the story.
`continuousConditionMet` reads it (Fili the Pathfinder, Thorin Oakenshield: 3 lines). Java's `RestartGameEffect` resets
only the blessing, so the story survives a restart here too (`RestartGameEffect.java:73`). Tests:
`enduringstory_test.go`. A dump shows no power or toughness, so no scenario can show the +1/+1.

The other Layer 4/5/6 rows of the "Still not resolved" table are not `Condition$` values or need more than tracked state
(a general `calculateAmount`, a host walk for `EffectZone$`, `ManaCost.getShortString`): untouched.
