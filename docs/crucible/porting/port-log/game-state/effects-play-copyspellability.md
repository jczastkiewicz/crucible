# Port Log — Game State: M6 Effects: Play and CopySpellAbility

- **Parent:** [`game-state.md`](../game-state.md) — Java counterpart, model, index, `Not ported yet`
- **Go:** [`internal/engine`](../../../../../crucible/internal/engine)

## Play and CopySpellAbility researched, not ported

Neither resolves; both stay `ErrUnimplemented`. Reason: the dominant corpus shape of each casts or copies an instant or
sorcery spell, and this port cannot put one on the stack. A permanents-only port would fail its game whenever the chosen
card is an instant or sorcery, which the dominant shapes cannot rule out.

**Not the blocker: the priority window.** Neither dominant shape needs a player to respond to anything.

| API                | Why no priority window is needed                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Play`             | Casts during resolution; timing is bypassed (`PlayEffect.java:460`, `playSaFromPlayEffect`), as `castWithoutPaying` (`discovereffect.go`) already does                                                    |
| `CopySpellAbility` | 164 of 255 lines are `Defined$ TriggeredSpellAbility` under a `Mode$ SpellCast` trigger. The trigger sits above the spell and resolves first under `ResolveStack`'s all-pass model, so the spell is there |

**The blocker: no instant or sorcery exists as a stack object.** `CastSpell` (`castspell.go`) casts only non-Aura
permanents and Auras; `castWithoutPaying` pushes only `APIPermanentCreature`/`APIPermanentNoncreature`. `ResolveStack`
(`stack.go`) pops and dispatches an `Ability`, and nothing moves a spell card off the stack after its effect.

### Play (330 corpus lines)

Java: `PlayEffect.java:84-493` (`resolve`), `PlayerControllerHuman.java:2416` / `PlayerControllerAi.java:1385`
(`playSaFromPlayEffect` → full `playSpellAbility`, cost payment and targeting included), `AbilityUtils`
`getSpellsFromPlayEffect`.

| Shape                                                                     | Lines | Casts                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| `Optional$`                                                               | 310   | --                                  |
| `WithoutManaCost$`                                                        | 284   | --                                  |
| `ValidSA$ Spell` (205 bare, more with `cmc` suffixes)                     | 264   | Any spell                           |
| `Defined$ Remembered` / `Valid$ Card.IsRemembered`                        | 128   | Whatever an earlier step exiled     |
| `ValidSA$`/`ValidTgts$`/`Valid$` naming only `Instant`/`Sorcery` per item | 63    | Only an instant or sorcery, always  |
| `CopyCard$`                                                               | 56    | A token copy cast from its zone     |
| `ReplaceGraveyard$`                                                       | 35    | Exile instead of graveyard, on cast |

A port reusing `castWithoutPaying` resolves permanent spells only: 63 lines always error, and most of the rest error
whenever the exiled or remembered card is an instant or sorcery. `Discover` takes that route (`discovereffect.go`); for
`Play` it is not an honest port of the dominant shape.

### CopySpellAbility (255 corpus lines)

Java: `CopySpellAbilityEffect.java:65-210` (`resolve`), `CardFactory.java:80-117` (`copySpellHost`, a `COPIED_SPELL`
card built from the original), `CardFactory.java:127-167` (`copySpellAbilityAndPossiblyHost`, costs cleared),
`MagicStack.java:680-681` (copy ceases to exist leaving the stack, CR 707.10a).

| Shape                                                           | Lines | Needs                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MayChooseTarget$`                                              | 207   | New targets for the copy (CR 707.10c)                   |
| `Defined$ TriggeredSpellAbility`                                | 164   | The `SpellCast` trigger's triggering stack item         |
| `TargetType$ Spell` / `ValidTgts$ Instant,Sorcery` and variants | 52    | Targeting a stack item                                  |
| `TargetType$ Activated`/`Triggered`, `ValidStack Ability...`    | 17    | Copy of an ability; same stack-item identity as above   |
| Copies of permanent spells (`Card.Outlaw`, `Creature.YouCtrl`)  | few   | Token on resolution (CR 707.10f), Layer 1 copiable data |

The 17 ability-copy lines are not carved out. Reason: they need the same stack-item identity the dominant shape needs,
and building it for 17 lines would decide that design ahead of it.

### Smallest real design, in order

1. **Instant/sorcery spell object.** Pick the card's `A:SP$` line (`Def.Faces[0].Abilities`), choose modes
   (`chooseCharmModes`) and targets (`resolveTargets`, `targeting.go:54`), pay or skip the cost, push
   `Ability{API, Params, Amounts, Targets}` with a spell marker, fire `SpellCast`, `checkSpellCastTriggers`,
   `checkBecomesTargetTriggers`. After resolution, `ResolveStack` moves the card Stack → Graveyard through replacement
   (`MagicStack.java:647-692`, `removeCardFromStack`). Unblocks `Play`, `Discover`'s rejected branch, the cast in
   `ChangeZoneEffect.java:1556`, `ReplaceGraveyard$`, flashback, and a consumer for `Game.MayPlayFromExile` (Airbend,
   Heist grants).
2. **CR 608.2b fizzle check** (`MagicStack.java:704-752`, `hasFizzled`), with step 1. Reachable without priority: a
   `SpellCast` trigger resolving above the spell, or `Play`'s own `SubAbility$` chain, can remove the spell's target.
3. **For `CopySpellAbility`:** stack-item identity (`Ability` has none); the triggering stack item on the `SpellCast`
   trigger's ability (`checkSpellCastTriggers`, `trigger.go`, records none); `Game.Clone` coverage for both; a copy-host
   card that ceases to exist leaving the stack; `MayChooseTarget$` through `ChooseTargets`; permanent-spell copies
   becoming tokens, which needs Layer 1 copiable values and overlaps `Clone`.
4. Steps 1-3 change `ResolveStack`'s and `Ability`'s documented contracts ("only the no-response case", "Nil for a cast
   ability"). ADR first (ADRP-4).

**Forge bugs (PORT-8).** None found.

**Researched and deferred.**
