// to true and the count of constants passing false is zero. Everything an
// effect needs comes from the game and the ability it is handed, so there is
// no per-resolution allocation and no instance per card.
//
// Resolve takes the resolving player's controller too, threaded from
// ResolveStack's own parameter of the same name -- discardEffect's own
// Mode$ TgtChoose (discardeffect.go) is the first implementation that needs
// to ask a player anything mid-resolution rather than reading the game state
// outright; every effect before it ignores the parameter.

// declined "may" is real Magic's own outcome regardless of whether this port

// (handleUnlessCost's own `alreadyPaid == isSwitched`, isSwitched false by
// default -- UnlessSwitched$'s own presence flips it, "pay to make it
